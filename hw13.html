    <h1>African elephant</h1>
    <p>African elephant is the biggest elephant in the world(in 2 times bigger than indian)
    Our zoo really got a luck to find, transportate them and keeping-on-eye these giant animals.
        Monthly keeping-on-eye price is 770$. Only master workers can do it and earn much money. Honestly,
        this is a variant for the bravest and the smartest workers. We search you for our elephant team and
        appreciate you!
